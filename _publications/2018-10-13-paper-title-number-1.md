This paper addresses the composite-rotating consensus problem of a class of second order multi-agent systems with time-delay. In order to solve the composite-rotating consensus problems, a distributed control protocol is introduced. Then the stability analysis is completed by using the method of frequency domain analysis and the maximum upper bound of time-delay is also obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results are verified by simulations.
