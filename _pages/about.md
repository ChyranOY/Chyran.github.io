I am in the second year of my PhD at the [Shanghai Innovation Institute](https://www.sii.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. Xiangyun Zhang at [the School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.ecnu.edu.cn/), [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/). I completed my academic master’s degree and undergraduate studies in Applied Statistics. I am a freshman focusing on the diffusion generative model, controllable video synthesis, and computer vision.
